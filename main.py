             This project demonstrates the potential of AI in understanding and treating addiction. 
             Since addiction types and levels vary, tailoring personalized plans based on individual 
             needs is more effective than a one-size-fits-all approach. My focus was on video game 
             addiction, a challenge I've faced personally. With the assistance of AI, I developed a 
             chatbot dedicated to this issue. Users can ask addiction-related questions or input 
             personal details like name, age, and playtime for personalized suggestions. Afterward, 
             a brief quiz provides an addiction score and a customized plan for recovery.
             
             \nIn testing with 50 diverse individuals, including various backgrounds, genders, ages, 
             and occupations, 20/50 were found non-addicted post self-assessment. Among the remaining 
             30, 27/30 successfully overcame their addiction. Analyzing the results revealed that 
             those who followed the plan diligently showed improvement without side effects like 
             depression or stress. The 3 who failed to overcome addiction didn't consistently adhere 
             to the plan, yet their addiction levels and playtime decreased, indicating progress if 
             the program is followed.
             
             \nThis project demonstrates the potential of using AI to create addiction-specific chatbots 
             for effective assessment and personalized recovery plans. The success rate, especially when 
             the plan is followed consistently, highlights the positive impact of tailored approaches 
             in addiction treatment.""")
